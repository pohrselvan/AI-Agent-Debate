# AI Debate Simulator using LangGraph + Ollama

This project simulates a structured debate between two AI agents using the [LangGraph](https://python.langchain.com/docs/langgraph/) framework, Model is loaded using ollama.

Each agent takes on a role (e.g., Scientist vs. Philosopher) and debates a given topic through several turns. A third AI (the Judge) evaluates the conversation and declares a winner.
